* Exercise 12 â€“ Setup a website based on WordPress on a multi-container architecture
  - Description :: Install a fresh new website based on the popular CMS WordPress using Docker compose. It should be composed by two containers: the first will act as frontend (webserver), while the second as backend (database). They should be interconnected and should also use a persistent volume for the =htdocs= folder.
    Finally check from your browser everything is working as expected.

* Solutions and Instructions
** Look at the Docker compose instructions
Look into this file: [[file:docker-compose.yml]] and try to understand what are the main configurations

** Install Docker compose
Your Docker host may be quite old does not include latest version of Docker compose, so install it
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
docker-compose --version
#+end_src

** Proceed with the installation
On your docker-host move into the exercise folder and install the multi-container website
#+begin_src sh
cd e12
export WP_PORT=90"${USER: -2}"
docker-compose -p $USER up -d
#+end_src

** Check output and running containers
Look at all the stages in the log and check what containers are running now
#+begin_src sh
docker ps
#+end_src

** Proceed with WordPress installation from your browser
Open =http://SERVER:WP_PORT= and proceed with minimal installation steps. Congratulations!!! You just installed your first microservices based application ;D

** Tear down the entire stack
To destroy a multi-container application just type:
#+begin_src sh
docker-compose -p $USER down -v
#+end_src
