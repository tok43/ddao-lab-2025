* Exercise 15 - Start a single pod using a spec file
  - Description :: Analyze the manifest file describing the Pod resource. Use it to create an object on your Kubernetes cluster. Try to scale object just created and manage objects that are running in your cluster.

* Solutions and Instructions
** Look at the Pod resource
   You can look at the Pod resource [[file:clock-pod.yaml][here]]

   Or you can look at the file on your VM
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cat clock-pod.yaml | yq e -PC | cat -n
   #+END_SRC

** Start the Pod on your cluster
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl create -f clock-pod.yaml
   #+END_SRC

   Alternatively, use an HTTP URL (/Properly replace variables/)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl create -f https://github.com/tok43/ddao-lab-$YEAR/-/raw/master/e$EX_NUM/clock-pod.yaml
   #+END_SRC

** Try to scale the Pod
   Pod cannot be scaled...

** Understanding the kubectl commands
   Try to guess differences between:
   - =kubectl create|apply=
   - =kubect run=

   The help may come in hand
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl run --help | head
   kubectl create --help | head
   kubectl apply --help | head
   #+END_SRC

** Manage the resources in your cluster
   Look at all resources
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl get all
   #+END_SRC

   Delete some of them and see what happen
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl delete pod clock-test --wait=false
   kubectl delete deploy myclock-dep
   kubectl get all
   kubectl delete deploy webserver-test
   #+END_SRC
