* Solutions and Instructions

Suggestion: The following instructions are generic and not intended to be copied/pasted. You are not a robot: be smart and think what you are doing.

** Install a Terminal (soft requirement)
*Given that you can use the terminal of the remote Lab VM (already installed), having a terminal on your laptop is not a strict requirement but it may be useful to practice with the Unix Shell commands which will be used extensively in this lab.*

*Windows*
- Download and install Cmder from this link: [[https://cmder.app][https://cmder.app/]]. Choose the *Full* version not the Mini. For simplicity just extract the archive on your Desktop


*Linux*
- Use the terminal provided by your system


*MacOS*
- Use the terminal provided by your system or install [[https://iterm2.com/][iTerm2]]

** Install OpenSSH (strict requirement)
*Windows*
- It is already included in Cmder, so no need to install manually if you have Cmder
- Alternatively, you could opt for Putty, see this page: https://www.putty.org/


*Linux*
- It should be already provided in your system, otherwise use your package manager to install it.
  
  Debian-based example
  #+begin_src sh
    apt search ssh # Search for ssh in available packages list
    apt install ssh -y
  #+end_src

  Test with
  #+begin_src sh
    man ssh
  #+end_src

*MacOS*
- It should be already provided in your system, otherwise use your package manager to install it.
  
  Brew enabled system example
  #+begin_src sh
    brew search ssh # Search for ssh in available packages list
    brew install openssh
  #+end_src

  Test with
  #+begin_src sh
    man ssh
  #+end_src

** Install a Text editor (soft requirement)
*Given that you can use (or install) any textual editor of your choice on the remote Lab VM, having a proper source code editor on your laptop is not a strict requirement but it may be useful to modify files locally, learn how-to track different versions and finally move them on the Lab VM using git*


*Windows*
- Install [[https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/][Notepad++]], [[https://www.sublimetext.com/3][Sublime Text]] o use your preferred one

*Linux*
- Install [[https://www.sublimetext.com/3][Sublime Text]] or use your preferred one

*MacOS*
- Install [[https://www.sublimetext.com/3][Sublime Text]] or use your preferred one

** Install git (soft requirement)
*Given that you can use git directly on the remote Lab VM, having it on your laptop is not a strict requirement but it may be useful to modify files locally, learn how-to track different versions and finally move them on the Lab VM using git*

*Windows*
- It is already included in Cmder, so no need to install manually
- Refer to this page: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

*Linux*
- Adapt /Install OpenSSH/ instructions above
