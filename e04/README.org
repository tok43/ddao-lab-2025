** Introduction
From now on we will use the =docker-host= environment prepare in the previous exercise, that one having the referred =Vagrantfile= at the root of the repository for all the exercises related with the second part of the lab involving PaaS, Docker and containers.

Before we need to install Docker on the host.

   Install Docker
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo apt-get install docker.io -y

   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   #+END_SRC

   Logout & Login again
