* Exercise 08 - Make two containers talking each others
  - Description :: Create a custom bridged network. Create two different container (a client and a server) and attach them to the same network. Finally use Docker internal DNS to communicate from one to the other.

* Solutions and Instructions
** Clear all stopped container (optional)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
   #+END_SRC
** Create a custom Docker network
   Look at the current Linux bridges
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   brctl show
   #+END_SRC

   Create the Docker custom network named =mynet-PLACEHOLDER=
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker network create mynet-${USER: -3}
   #+END_SRC

   Look at the network that has been created
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker network list
   #+END_SRC

   Look at the Linux bridge that has been created
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   brctl show
   #+END_SRC

** Create the server
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   #docker run -d --net mynet-${USER: -3} --name server-${USER: -3} busybox nc -l 0.0.0.0:7000
   docker run -d --net mynet-${USER: -3} --name server-${USER: -3} nginx
   #+END_SRC

** Create the client and test
   Get your personal placeholder
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     MY_PH=`echo ${USER: -3}`
     echo $MY_PH
   #+END_SRC

   Create the personal client and test on your personal server
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   #docker run --net mynet-${USER: -3} busybox echo 'PING' | nc server-$MY_PH 7000
   docker run --net mynet-${USER: -3} busybox wget -S server-$MY_PH:80 -O -
   #+END_SRC
