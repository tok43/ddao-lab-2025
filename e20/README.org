* Exercise 20 - Create a multi-node cluster
  - Description :: Delete the current cluster which is composed by a
    single worker node (the master node) and create a fresh new
    cluster composed by one master node and two worker nodes. Check
    cluster and nodes status.

* Solutions and Instructions
** Remove the single node cluster to save resources
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kind delete cluster --name $USER
   #+END_SRC

** Inspect the Kind manifest of a multi-node cluster
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cat kind-multi-node.yaml | yq e -C | cat -n
   #+END_SRC

** Create a new multi-node cluster with =kind=
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kind create cluster --config kind-multi-node.yaml --name $USER
   #+END_SRC

** Ensure =kubectl= points to the new cluster
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl config current-context
   #+END_SRC

** Ensure cluster is up and running
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl cluster-info
   #+END_SRC

** Inspect the three node status
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   kubectl get nodes
   #+END_SRC
