* Exercise 06 â€“ Build a custom Docker image
  - Description :: Create a personalised image starting from a generic one. Understand how and why your image is different from the initial one. Play with layers and start a container based on the custom image.

* Solutions and Instructions
** Start an ubuntu based image
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   docker run -it ubuntu
   #+END_SRC
** Try to use the figlet utility
   You should get an error since it is not present on the default ubuntu container.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   figlet "DDaO Course"
   #+END_SRC
** Install a package and use it
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   apt-get update
   apt-get install figlet
   figlet "DDaO Course"
   exit
   #+END_SRC
** Show differences from the base image
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker diff <containerID>
   #+END_SRC
** Commit changes creating a new layer and the respective image.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker commit <containerID>
   #+END_SRC
   The output is the new image ID (=newImageID=)

   Look at images now
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker images
   #+END_SRC
** Start a new container from that image
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker run -it <newImageID>
   #+END_SRC

   Exit from that container
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   exit
   #+END_SRC
** Give a name to the image
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker tag <newImageID> figlet-${USER: -3}
   #+END_SRC
   Or specify the tag as an extra argument of the commit
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker commit <containerID> figlet-${USER: -3}
   #+END_SRC
** Look at the available images
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker images
   #+END_SRC
** Understand how layers are the building block of images
   Look at the differences between =figlet= image and =ubuntu= image.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker inspect ubuntu | jq -C .[].RootFS | cat -n
   docker inspect figlet-${USER: -3} | jq -C .[].RootFS | cat -n
   #+END_SRC
** Start a container based on that image using name
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker run -it figlet-${USER: -3}
   #+END_SRC
** Use the binary that is already available this time
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   figlet "DDaO Course"
   #+END_SRC
