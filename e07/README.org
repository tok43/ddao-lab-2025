* Exercise 07 - Build a Docker image using a Dockerfile
  - Description :: After completing last exercise try to build the very same image but using a Dockerfile instead of creating it from a running container. Understand how and why your image is different from the initial one. Give it a name and a tag and optionally upload it on the public Docker registry. Finally start a container based on the custom image.

* Solutions and Instructions
** Write a Dockerfile
   You can look at this [[file:Dockerfile][Dockerfile]].

   =FROM= command _must_ be at the very first line
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   FROM <original_image>
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   In =<original_image>= we could specify a tag, if not =latest= is used:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ubuntu
   ubuntu:latest
   ubuntu:bionic
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Build the image
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker build -t hub.docker.com/myfiglet-${USER: -3} .
   #+END_SRC
** List all images
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker image list
   #+END_SRC
** Give it a different tag
   Default tag is =latest=, we can add a new one to mark our very specific version
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker tag hub.docker.com/myfiglet-${USER: -3}:latest hub.docker.com/myfiglet-${USER: -3}:v1
   #+END_SRC

   List all images again
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker image list
   #+END_SRC

** Upload it to the Docker Hub (optional)
   Login into Docker Hub (hub.docker.com)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker login
   #+END_SRC

   Push your image /(please look next step before)/
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker push hub.docker.com/myfiglet-${USER: -3}
   #+END_SRC

   The above command can not work because Docker Hub has namespaces-based permission. If I had been logged in, I would have used something like:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker tag hub.docker.com/myfiglet-${USER: -3}:latest dsantoro/myfiglet:v1
   docker push dsantoro/myfiglet:v1
   #+END_SRC

** Start a new container from the new image
   =figlet= utility is already there
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   docker run -it dsantoro/myfiglet:v1
   figlet "Best course of the year ;D"
   #+END_SRC
